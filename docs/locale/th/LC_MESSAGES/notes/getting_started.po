"**Start-end of sentence marking** - This is arguably the biggest problem "
"for the field of Thai NLP. The lack of end of sentence marking (EOS) "
"makes it hard for researchers to create training sets, the basis of most "
"research in this field. The root of the problem is two-pronged. In terms "
"of writing system, Thai uses space to indicate both commas and periods. "
"No letter indicates an end of a sentence. In terms of language use, Thais"
" have a habit of starting their sentences with connector terms such as "
"'because', 'but', 'following', etc, making it often hard even for natives"
" to decide where the end of sentence should be when translating."

"**Word segmentation** - Thai does not use space and word segmentation is "
"not easy. It boils down to understanding the context and ruling out words"
" that do not make sense. This is a similar issue that other Asian "
"languages such as Japanese and Chinese face in different degrees. For "
"languages with space, a similar but less extreme problem would be multi-"
"word expressions, like the French word for potato — 'pomme de terre'. In "
"Thai, the best known example is \"ตา-กลม\" and \"ตาก-ลม\". As of recent, "
"new techniques that capture words, subwords, and letters in vectors seem "
"poised to overcome to issue."
